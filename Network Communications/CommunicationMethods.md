The dart:io library provides a number of classes and functions for network communication in the Dart programming language. Some of the main methods of network communication in the dart:io library include:

- Sockets: The dart:io library provides a number of classes for creating and using sockets, including Socket, ServerSocket, and RawSocket. These classes allow you to create client and server applications that can send and receive data over a network using a variety of protocols, including TCP and UDP.

- HTTP: The dart:io library also provides classes for working with HTTP, including HttpClient, HttpServer, and HttpClientRequest. These classes allow you to create HTTP client and server applications that can send and receive HTTP requests and responses.

- WebSockets: The dart:io library includes support for WebSockets, which allow for bidirectional communication between a client and a server over a single connection. The dart:io library provides the WebSocket class for creating and using WebSockets.

- Other network protocols: The dart:io library also includes support for other network protocols, such as FTP and SMTP. You can use the classes and functions provided by the library to create applications that can send and receive data over these protocols.

Overall, the dart:io library provides a wide range of tools for network communication in Dart, allowing you to create a variety of client and server applications that can communicate over the network.
